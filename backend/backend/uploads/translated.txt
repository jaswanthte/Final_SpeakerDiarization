Speaker Guest-1: Hello everyone. I need help with the Africa Rail. Mr. Niranjana Reddy told me that you have a spare helmet that you can give me for free. They will talk to me and they will come to you. They will take the helmet off the black box for me when they come home. They will also take off the helmet in Rangit. I am very happy to be able to do this class and the glass and T-shirt for me. Speaker Guest-1: I have to thank you both. I know one thing. Ranji Trophy has two bands. They are sponsoring it. I am very happy. Why do we have this with you very much? Speaker Guest-2: Speaker Guest-1: "Can you please say it in Telugu? He went to Africa and was very proud. He wants to support me because he rides a bike. Anchor Sreemukhi: "I have never forgotten our Telugu community and our Indian pride. We must uphold it even in Africa."
